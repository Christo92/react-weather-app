# 🌦️ React Weather App

A responsive weather forecast application built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Framer Motion**.
It displays the current weather, a 5-day forecast, and supports light/dark mode. The app fetches weather data from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```
git clone git@github.com:Christo92/react-weather-app.git
cd react-weather-app
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```

```

### 3. Setup the API key
To use the app, you need an API key from OpenWeatherMap:

- Create a free account at openweathermap.org
- Go to API keys
- Subscribe to the Current Weather Data (free tier is enough)
- Copy your API key

Then, create a .env file at the root of the project:

```
VITE_APP_OPENWEATHERMAP_ID="your_api_key_here"
```

> ⚠️ Replace "your_api_key_here" with your actual API key.

### 4. Start the development server

```
npm run dev
```
